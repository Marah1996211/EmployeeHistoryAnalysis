##Analysis Report: Employee Department Management System
1. Project Overview
The Employee Department Management System is a relational database system designed to manage and track various employee-related data, including their departments, roles, salaries, and titles. The system facilitates queries that provide valuable insights into the organization's structure, employee history, and compensation, among other things.

The system consists of several interconnected tables, each representing a different entity (e.g., departments, employees, salaries). It is designed to streamline HR operations by making it easier to retrieve specific employee and department data based on various conditions such as department membership, salary details, and hire dates.

2. Schema Design
Key Entities:
Department: Stores information about different departments in the organization. Each department has a unique dept_no and dept_name.
Employees: Contains personal and job-related information about employees, including their emp_no, first_name, last_name, sex, birth_date, hire_date, and the emp_title_id linking them to their titles.
Salaries: Keeps records of employee salaries, linking each salary record to an employee.
Titles: Contains a list of job titles, each identified by a title_id.
Dept_Employee (dept_emp): Links employees to the departments they belong to. It defines which employees work in which departments.
Dept_Manager: Tracks which employees are managers of specific departments. Each department has a designated manager.
Relationships:
One-to-Many: An employee can work in many departments over time, and each department can have multiple employees.
Many-to-Many: Employees can hold multiple titles, and departments can have multiple employees. These relationships are implemented using the dept_emp and dept_manager tables to map these many-to-many relationships.
One-to-One: An employee has one salary, and the salary is directly associated with the employee's emp_no.
Foreign Key Constraints: The schema enforces data integrity with foreign keys, ensuring that departments, employees, and titles are properly linked. The system ensures that:
An employee can only belong to existing departments.
A department manager must be a valid employee.
Each employeeâ€™s title must exist in the titles table.
3. Data Integrity and Constraints
The database schema relies on several constraints to ensure data consistency and integrity:

Primary Keys: Each table uses primary keys to uniquely identify records. For instance:

emp_no is the primary key in the employees table.
dept_no is the primary key in the department table.
The dept_emp and dept_manager tables use composite primary keys to ensure unique records for each employee-department pairing.
Foreign Keys: Foreign key constraints are used to link data between tables and ensure referential integrity. For example:

The dept_emp table has foreign keys that link emp_no to the employees table and dept_no to the department table.
The dept_manager table links managers to departments and employees.
Data Types: The use of proper data types for each field, such as VARCHAR for strings, INTEGER for numbers, and DATE for dates, ensures that data is correctly stored and processed.

4. Normalization
The schema appears to be normalized to at least the third normal form (3NF):

1NF (First Normal Form): Each table has a primary key, and all attributes contain atomic values.
2NF (Second Normal Form): There are no partial dependencies; each non-prime attribute depends on the whole primary key.
3NF (Third Normal Form): No transitive dependencies exist, as non-prime attributes are directly dependent on the primary key.
This normalization ensures that data redundancy is minimized, and data integrity is maintained.
